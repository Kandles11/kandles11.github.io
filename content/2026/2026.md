As the year comes to a close, I've reflected back on the last year and spent some time trying to decide what I wanted to change for the new year. 

I recall seeing an Instagram reel at some point during this year that talked about how to choose a new years resolution. Well, not quite a specific resolution, but a theme. A theme to define the year, rather than concrete goals. This is supposed to let you approach the theme as you see fit. Rather than saying "I want to climb a v10 boulder this year", say "I want to improve at bouldering". This shifts the focus from the unachieved milestones and instead on the growth that *did* happen. 

The theme for 2026 is... *drumroll*

**The year of making**

Often times I lay in bed and come up with fun things to make. It can be practical, it can be just for fun, but all the ideas come and go, with nothing coming out of it. 2026 is the year it changes. Even if I only finish with one great product made, it'll be something I can be proud of and show off. When I say making, I don't want to limit myself to just physical creations or software. The year of making is just about creation. That could look like a photography session, drawings I hang up on the wall, or articles I write on this website. Thats the theme for the year, and I'm excited to see what I come up with this year. 

I hope to share progress within the next 12 months.

See ya'll in 2026 🫡
