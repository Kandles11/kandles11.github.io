    <p>I've always wanted to build a webpage to just store whatever I was doing. In times past,
        I would have created a React site, maybe Astro, and would've tried to make it look as great
        and "modern" as possible. After years of <i>not</i> having a website, I decided it was time
        to just throw something together and have a functional page where I can just drop whatever I please.
        This is my new home for thoughts, photos, projects, experiments, and anything I want to share.
        All you'll find here is a massive folder of html documents, and maybe some images thrown in. 
        This is not a portfolio, this is not a demonstration of my skills, simply a place to store and
        share bits and pieces of my life.

        <h2>ok, but how does it work?</h2>

    <p>This entire webpage was shamelessly ripped-off from a webpage I found from a YouTube video,
        both attached below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqL3jvlU61c">How DOOM Will Teach You What CS Degrees Miss</a> (youtube.com)</li>
            <li><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/html/index.html">All You May Need is HTML</a> (fabiensanglard.net)</li>
        </ol>
    <p>
        After seeing this page, I was inspired, and knew I had to make something like it. With that being said,
        I generated a Python script with ChatGPT to make a simple generator, and created my first "article.html" (we're here now.)
        Paired with Inspect Element, I was able to write up some dead simple CSS, getting us to where we are today.

    <div class=heading>
        <h2>but whats next?</h2>
        <hr>
    </div>

    <p>
        My plans going forward from this point are simple. Write more, fill the site with my favorite things,
        and just wait and see what happens.
