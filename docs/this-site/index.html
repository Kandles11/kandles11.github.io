        <h2>why does this exist?</h2>

    <p>I've always wanted to build a webpage to just store whatever I was doing. Previously,
        I would have created a React site, maybe Astro, and would've tried to make it look as great
        and "modern" as possible. Everytime I went and tried to do this, I would burn myself out and end
        up just <i>not</i> having a website. After years of <i>not</i> having a website, I decided it was time
        to just throw something together and have a functional page where I can just drop whatever I please.
        Here, im hoping to just drop my thoughts, photos, projects, experiments, and anything I want to share.
        All you'll find here is a massive folder of html documents, and maybe some images thrown in. 
        This is not a portfolio, this is not a demonstration of my skills, simply a place to store and
        share what I've done.
    </p>

    <div class="heading">
        <h2>ok, but how does it work?</h2>
        <hr>
    </div>

    <p>This entire website was shamelessly ripped-off from an article I found from a YouTube video,
        both attached below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqL3jvlU61c">How DOOM Will Teach You What CS Degrees Miss</a> (youtube.com)</li>
            <li><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/html/index.html">All You May Need is HTML</a> (fabiensanglard.net)</li>
        </ol>
    <p>
        After seeing this page, I was inspired, and knew I had to make something like it. With that being said,
        I generated a Python script with ChatGPT to make a simple html generator, and created my first <code>article.html</code> (we're here now.)
        Paired with Inspect Element, I was able to write up some dead simple CSS, getting us to where we are now. There's a ton more I'm hoping to
        implement, but for now, I should be able to get by.
    </p>

<section>
    <div class=heading>
        <h2>but whats next?</h2>
        <hr>
    </div>

    <p>
        My plans going forward from this point are simple. Write more, fill the site with my favorite things,
        and just wait and see what happens.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the technical side, I want to find an effective way to store some of my favorite photos that
        I've taken. Dropping 30MB photos into the source is  not the solution, so this will definitely
        require some more thinking on how I'll approach it. Furthermore, I'm hoping to have a semi-dynamic
        way of pulling from a "Liked Videos" playlist on Youtube or the latest songs I've been listening to
        on Apple Music. I'm anticipating having to build a dead simple API to handle that.
    </p>

    <p>But for now, I have my folder of HTML documents, and that'll do just fine for now.</p>
